## Getting Started

Generate static web sites from markdown pages. Supports multiple themes. It's still in a very early stage of development.

### Installing

Make sure you have **Python 2.7** and **pip** installed on your system. Then install all the requirements from the `requirements.txt` file:

```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

After that, **gumbal** should already work.
